# Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```sh
npx hardhat help
```
```sh
npx hardhat node
```
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
```sh
npx run start
```
